ðŸ¥— Healthy Eating Behavior Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes healthy eating patterns using a dataset of 2,000 meal records.
It focuses on nutrition composition, diet types, cooking methods, and health ratings to understand what factors contribute to healthier meals.
The goal is to identify trends in eating habits and provide actionable recommendations for healthier meal planning.
